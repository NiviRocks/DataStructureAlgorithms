___
> **N Queen Algorithm**  
___
*[Get Code Link Here](https://github.com/NiviRocks/DataStructureAlgorithms/blob/d8c59a2574e86bcef60acb55f5cdd76762d70b28/nqueen.c)*
 - This algorithm finds the positions for n number of queens in n X n chess board such that there
   are no queen that attack any other queen. 
 - The algorithm uses backtracking.
 - Example of a solution for 8 X 8 chess board with 8 queen: <details><summary>Click Here</summary>

 - Time complexity of the Algorithm is: `O(N!)`  
___
> **Stack Implementation**  
___
*[Get Code Link Here](https://github.com/NiviRocks/DataStructureAlgorithms/blob/main/stack%20using%20linked%20list.py)*
 - Stack implementation using linked list that allows functions like ```push()```, ```pop()``` and ``` display()```
 - A stack always follows LIFO rule.

> **Deadline Based Job Selection Algorithm**  
___
*[Get Code Link Here](https://github.com/NiviRocks/DataStructureAlgorithms/blob/main/deadline-based-job-scheme.c)*  
- ```job```, ```profit``` gained by completing them along with ```deadline``` for completing them is provided.
 - We need to find the jobs that should be selected in order to gain maximum profit within **Overall Deadline for All Jobs**
 - Example : <details><summary>Click Here</summary>  
   - Given Jobs, Profits and Deadlines ->

   - Let Max Deadline be: 4  
   - Then selected jobs and the deadline selected to finish them are:
